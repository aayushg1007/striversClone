# Project Motivation

The original Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet, which included direct links to third-party resources, was later privatized. This project restores access to the original curriculum and its external references for the benefit of learners and the developer community.

## Live Demo

The dashboard can be accessed directly through GitHub Pages:

https://aayushg1007.github.io/striversClone/

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/aayushg1007/striversClone.git
  cd striversClone
  ```
2. You can also open `index.html` in your browser locally. No build step or server is required.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Main dashboard UI and logic
- `data.js`: Course data (curriculum JSON)
- `dashnew.html`: Optional or legacy dashboard version
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## Customization

- To update the curriculum, edit or replace `data.js`.
- Styling can be adjusted using the Tailwind CSS CDN included in the project.
